# StandAloneFramework
This was a project I created to test an idea - Defer all the functionality, error handling, method execution to a framework....Its still an on going idea :)

*** Still to Do ***
[*] Add a multithreading handler that can create tasks and manage the "lifecycle" of a task, if there are two subsequent tasks, wait for the one to end then execute the second task etc.
[*] An implementation of an ORM - either NHibernate or Entity Framework
[*] Performance improvements --> always room for improvements
